## Python – Input/Output Fundamentals

This project focuses on understanding how Python handles input and output
operations, with an emphasis on file manipulation and data persistence.

The goal of the project is to practice working with files safely and efficiently,
using built-in Python tools, while also learning how to store and retrieve data
through JSON serialization.

### Project Objectives

By completing this project, you will learn how to:
- Open and close files properly using context managers (`with`)
- Read files in different ways (entire content vs line-by-line)
- Write to and append data in text files
- Convert Python objects to JSON format
- Reconstruct Python objects from JSON data
- Work with object attributes and dictionary representations
- Handle command-line arguments and standard input

### Key Concepts Covered
- File handling in Python
- Text and JSON serialization
- Object-to-dictionary conversion
- Data persistence
- Standard input processing
