## Python – File Handling & Serialization

This repository includes multiple Python scripts that demonstrate fundamental
Input/Output concepts in Python. It focuses on working with files correctly and
handling data serialization using JSON.

The project covers:
- Safe file opening and closing using the `with` statement
- Reading files entirely or line by line
- Writing to and appending text files
- Converting Python objects to JSON and reconstructing them back

### Repository Structure

- **main_files/**  
  Contains main scripts used to test and demonstrate the implemented functions.

### File Descriptions

- **0.** Reads a UTF-8 text file and prints its content to standard output  
- **1.** Function that returns the total number of lines in a text file  
- **2.** Function that reads a given number of lines from a file and prints them  
- **3.** Writes a string to a text file and returns the number of characters written  
- **4.** Appends a string to the end of a text file and returns the number of characters added  
- **5.** Converts a Python object into a JSON string representation  
- **6.** Converts a JSON string back into a Python data structure  
- **7.** Writes a Python object to a file using JSON format  
- **8.** Creates a Python object from data stored in a JSON file  
- **9.** Script that gathers command-line arguments, saves them into a list, and writes the list to a file  
- **10.** Returns the dictionary representation of an object using `obj.__dict__`  
- **11.** Defines a `Student` class that provides a dictionary representation of its instance  
- **12.** Extends the `Student` class to return only selected attributes  
- **13.** Transfers attributes from one `Student` instance to another  
- **14.** Generates Pascal’s Triangle as a list of lists of integers  
- **15.** Searches for lines containing a specific string and inserts text accordingly  
- **16.** Reads standard input line by line and computes aggregated metrics
